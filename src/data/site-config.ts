        text: "üëã Hello! I'm a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student with a strong passion for cybersecurity.\n\nüîí My journey into the world of cybersecurity began with a curiosity about how systems are protected against threats. This curiosity quickly evolved into a commitment to mastering the skills necessary to safeguard digital environments.\n\nüíª I believe in the power of consistent learning and improvement. Each day, I dedicate time to expanding my knowledge through courses and practical experiences. This approach has provided me with a solid foundation in areas such as network security, ethical hacking, and vulnerability assessment.\n\nüìö Throughout my academic career, I have focused on courses and projects that enhance my technical skills and understanding of cybersecurity principles. Engaging in hands-on labs and simulations has allowed me to apply what I've learned in real-world scenarios.\n\n\tüîß My technical toolkit includes:\n\t\t‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Programming in Python, Java, and C++\n\t\t‚Ä¢‚Å†  Cybersecurity tools like Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, and Burp Suite\n\t\t‚Ä¢‚Å†  Understanding of network protocols, encryption, and security frameworks\n\nüåü I'm interested in roles involving threat analysis, penetration testing, and cybersecurity consulting. I am eager to contribute to teams dedicated to protecting data and ensuring the integrity of systems.",
